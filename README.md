# MysticRealms
Mystic Realms is a 2D RPG game made in the GoDot game engine. As the word RPG suggests, player will take on the role of a fantasy hero, embarked on an epic journey. 
Players would need to navigate through different levels, finding loot or killing monsters.

Everyone has dreamed about being a hero. However the opportunity is hard to come by for everyone. Plus, who doesnâ€™t like swords and magic?
This is where our motivation came from. We wanted to craft a game that could help deliver people a unique experience. One filled with danger and the promise to become a legend.
